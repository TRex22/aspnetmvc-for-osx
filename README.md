# ASP.NET MVC 5 Template for Xamarin Studio

![](http://cl.ly/image/0U3E3b260K3o/hanssens_aspnetmvc-for-osx.jpg)
A fully working and clean ASP.NET MVC 5 project for Xamarin Studio. Purrs excellent on Mac OSX. 

In short:

* It's an ASP.NET MVC 5 application
* That also means RAZOR support
* Can be run entirely from Xamarin Studio
* Can be updated and extended through NuGet
* It just works...
